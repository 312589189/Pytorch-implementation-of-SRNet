# SRNet model Pytorch Implementation:

Model trained weights can be foud at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wOhXdC9jWjYH60-qwTwegv1W-rWH5dVk
The model weight is trained on the S-Uniward 0.4bpp in the same setting as reported in the paper:
"Deep Residual Network for Steganalysis of Digital Images"
The model can be tested using the file test.py
